          UX CASE STUDY OF ASK A MOM
        </h1>
        <p>Parenting is a difficult job that comes with no user manual. Despite there being a great number of parenting books, Iâ€™ve found that parents often trust the advice of other parents. If they find someone who has lived through what they are
          now, they find comfort in listening and following their advice. That is the premise for my app ASK A MOM. The purpose of the app ASK A MOM is to help create an online community of moms who guide and support each other in raising their kids.
        </p>
        <p>
          The app was a part of a 500 hour CareerFoundry certification course. We were asked to build an app that uses Expert opinion and advice. I chose to build this particular app because it felt personal and was something I could relate to.

        <h2>
          My Approach
        </h2>
        <p>
          The first thing I did was develop a problem statement. Doing this made me realize I need to narrow down my scope for the app to make it something that I can design in the given amount of time.
          The next thing I did was to identify my potential user base. I conducted user interviews with my target users in different phases. In the first phase, user interviews were done to understand the potential problems. This was followed by
          creating user personas and user stories to understand how the user would navigate through the app and solve their problem. Creating user journeys paved the way to create the first rough sketches followed by Balsamiq images of how the
          wireframes of the app would look like. Wireframes were created in three stages- low, mid-fidelity and high-fidelity. Changes were made on the way to ensure that the wireframes were still guided by the original user journeys. Before creating
          the high-fidelity wireframes and prototype, another round of interviews conducted and based on the results the final prototype was made. While refining my prototype what also helped was advice from my mentor, which made me realize that one
          user journey was left incomplete. I went back and made changes to ensure that the final prototype reflected the basic objectives of the app.

          User Research and Analysis
        </h3>

        <div>
          <p>
            At this stage I first conducted user interviews to determine the needs and frustrations of the target users.
            For the first round of interviews, I spoke to 3 moms with kids in different age groups . This was done to understand the different kind of parenting struggles/journeys that users go through. The different age groups of kids chosen were:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Moms with toddlers</li>
            <li>Moms with young children</li>
            <li>Moms with teenagers</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Affinity mapping was used to group and understand the information collected from the interviews.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>
          User personas
        </h3>
        <p>
          With the information gathered from the user interviews, I created user personas representing the target users of the app.

        </div>
        <h3>
          User journeys
        </h3>
        <p>
          Once the user personas had been created and established, I was able to identify what the end goal of each user was and what their journey through the app would be like, to achieve that end goal. User journey mapping was conducted to
          better visualize and stay focussed on the user-centric design process.

        Site Map
      </h3>
      <p>
        I now worked on the Information Architecture of the app. The user journeys I had created before helped in this process.

      <h3>
        Wireframes
      </h3>
      <p>
        It was now time to put the ideas and concepts of the app into a visual form. First, I created the different screens on paper and used arrows to indicate the user flow and navigation within the app.I created rough sketches of the main
        features of the app using Balsamiq. This was followed by focussing on the placement of the UI elements in the app.
